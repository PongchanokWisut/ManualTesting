    - **My Comment**
      - 6/11/64 - I started learning software testing on youtube - I was so overwhelmed with theories and tools of software testing. In the surface, It seemed to be an easy job but when I dig deeper into the SDLC and STLC. It's more complicated than I thought it was. What I knew was I have to work with many other departments (Dev , Product Owner , Project Manager etc.) to make a software the best as we can before deploying. First of all , I should get my feet wet by doing a project to put what I learned into practice , make myself more confident and learn more about what I don't understand so I can seek help and will be able understand it eventually.
      - 8/11/64 - I started a manual testing project - One day I found a channel teaching software testing. Mr.Pavan introduced me a eCommerce demo website which is suitable for practicing manual testing when you are a new comer of the software testing field. He gave me FRS and Test Plan documents so I could start the project with directions. He also gave me some guidelines about the whole process of manual testing, how to write a good test scenarios and test cases. So, I started this project by learning about this applcation as much as possiible from FRS and Exploration, test plan also helped me to know where I had to test and where I hadn't.
      - 15/11/64 - It's not easy at all!! - I finished writing test scenarios for all the functionlities of the application.But when I started writing test cases, I hit the wall(maybe I use the wrong idiom here but that's it). I could just think of some basic test cases which I had no idea how It would cover all the functionalities of a page. Let's say Register functionality, What I could think of were test cases like (valid , invalid E-mail and Password). So, I had to search for more example and how to write a better test case from the different resources (Youtube and some webboards).
